Capital One Summit 2017 Coding Challenge - Here's The Plan.  by Alec Lam, Carnegie Mellon University

The concept behind my web application using the Yelp Fusion API is to provide a clean, simple, and easy to use application to quickly decide plans for people who are indecisive. This application streamlines decision by restricting only a few options for users to choose from based on instinct, which makes the decision making process simpler and not as overwhelming as other options. Because of these design choices, I developed a responsive, browser and mobile friendly web application with simple features to get right to the audiences' goals. On the search page, I give a brief explanation of what the application is and what it is meant to do. The user will then input their location and a word that is associated with whatever they want to do. Next, they will see a results page of only three results of options, based on their specified criteria. This allows the users to find quick options for what they want, without being overloaded by information and choices. If the user is not satisfied with the choices, he or she can return to the results screen and try a more specific key word or a different word in the search.


The main motivation for an individual using this site is to eliminate indecision in planning a meal or activities. I was able to implement this application using a Ruby on Rails framework, Postgres database, and Heroku. I utilized the Yelp Fusion Search function to narrow down results for the users within the Rails application. The front end design was developed without a framework and was developed using customized HTML5 and CSS.
